<br>•   Integration Testing: For testing paths between units.
<br>•   System Testing: For testing paths between subsystems.
<h3>What is Black box Testing?</h3>
Black-box testing is a method of software testing that examines the functionality of an application based on the specifications. It is also known as Specifications based testing. Independent Testing Team usually performs this type of testing during the software testing life cycle.Black Box Testing method is applicable to the following levels of software testing:
