Welcome to the second blog of our project. In the initial blog, we introduced our team and the purposes. In this blog we are going to discuss further development about our android application. 
We choose the title "Time Tracker" for our application which is basically an activity monitor. 
<h2>Overview</h2>
The requirements are divided into two phases
<br>1.Gathering Customer Requirements
<br>2.Requirements Analysis

<h2>Customer Requirements</h2>
In the initial meetings with the customer, we have discussed back and forth with the customer and got to know his specific requirements and further classified into three categories
<br>1.Essential requirements
<br>2.Necessary requirements
<br>3.Nice to have  features
<h3>1.Essential requirements</h3>
These are the basic and the must have features for the application to work as per 
      customer specifications
<br>• The application should work offline.
<br>• Application should store data at least for the past six months.
<br>• The data should be entered manually whenever the user desires.
<br>• The activity should have the categories so that the user can distinguish between personal and professional activity.
<br>• The activities are to be colour coded so that user can have ease of use.
<br>• Application should be able to filter the past data/history as per user desired weekly or monthly.
<h3>2.Necessary Requirements</h3>
<br>• The data should be displayed in bar graph form and can be viewed in text form if further required.
<br>• The user should have the freedom to import and export data from other mobile phones or Email.
<br>• Application should send a weekly report to the user Email if the user desires.
<br>• Application should be password/PIN protected.

<h3>3.Nice to have Features</h3>
<br>• Push notification if the user does the same activity at same time for more than 10 consecutive days.
<br>• Saving the location of the activity using inbuilt GPS.
<br>• Freedom to take the pictures of the activity.
<br>• User can plan the goals with in the application.

<h2>Requirements Analysis</h2>
 We placed ourselves in the user shoes and analyzed the customer requirements what and why are the requirements important and we came up with few user stories.

<h2>User Stories</h2>

<br>•	As a user, I want an application to track all my daily activities and schedule my daily plan efficiently.
<br>•	As a user, I want to mainly categorize my activities as professional, sports and daily routines.
<br>•	As a user, I want to save some information or my activities for future and don’t want to store any data no longer than 6 months to minimize space usage.
<br>•	As a user, I want to customise categories on my own as possibly the developers cannot think of every posssible activity of an individual.
<br>•	As a user, I would like to have access to my app even when there is no internet service.
<br>•	As a user, I would like to enter my data manually as this keeps track of my past time and this is not a scheduler/calendar.
<br>•	As a user, I want to secure my application, using a pin.
<br>•	As a user, I would like to export/import data between androids phones.
<br>•	As a user, I want my application to notify me of my regular activities so that I need not to enter every day.
<br>•	As a user, I want my app to display various activities in different colours for ease of use.
<br>•	As a user, I should be able to edit my data and easy to read like a pictorial representation of graph/bar/pie chart.
<br>•	As a user, I want to filter my history depending on time frame/type of activity.
<br>•	As a user, It would be nice have activity data updated to me weekly via Email automatically.
<br>•	As a user, It would be good to have the pictures and location of my activity if I desire.

Down below is the simple description of user stories same as above.

<h2>Wrong Assumptions</h2>
We left a couple of things in the plain sight, realized and identified these wrong assumptions later.
<br>• We comprehended the app should be similar to the calendar but a complex but realized it's not after the second meeting with the customer.
<br>• We assumed the app should be online like most of the apps today.
<br>• Colour coding has never crossed our mind and later realized its importance.

In our next blog post, we would explain more about the system design.
