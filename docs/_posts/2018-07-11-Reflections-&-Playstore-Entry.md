<h2>About TimeTracker</h2>
Now, we are into final stage of our course app "TimeTracker". In this blog we are share our experiences and challenges faced while developing this app. As it is said nothing comes without a challenge, same goes to mobile development. There are many technical challenges developers face when making mobile apps for the enterprise. The major challenges and their possible solutions are essential to identify so as smooth mobile development process could be possible.
<h2>Techincal Challenges</h2>
To compete with the already existing and established big giants in app development, you need to come up with innovative technologies and dynamic applications that help you play smartly and quickly than your competitors.In the competitive world of Mobile applications, there are various challenges faced on the Technical front. Over coming the Challenges in an appropriate manner leads to the development of a successful application.  
<br>• Gathering the requirements from the customer, we will have the necessary part to create consumer articles with a thorough knowledge of our technology and knowledge.Since the requirements are sorted and satisfied with customer requirements, designing the next working system, it's a very complicated process because there is no idea how to do anything, so we have divided our work within the given time frame.We do not know what development strategies are and how to implement it. Then we write code and the Android platform is completely new to us, no one of our team members has experience in developing an app on Android. Hence the main challenge is to understand the Android ecosystem and work around it. As a team we have never worked in a programming language with JAVA for creating an Android app. We started by making it known to the Android studio which is a taskbank and has all the tools one needs to ever create an Android application. 
<br>• Android Studio is important in underlying development because you can not drive a car without knowing the transmission and gear transfer if you do not have automatic transmittance of software development. Before working on the code we will have to arrange a device for coding devices and work accordingly. We're confident with Android Studio, we have started developing the application. Starting a Hello World! A step-by-step program in learning programming language. When we were adequately confident, we started developing the interface and started coding the application. Another problem we have is package name convention and we can not recognize that it can cause problems when combining problems in the future and putting together code, we realize this when we have finished the parts of the app and putting them together. The code is really worse, though it's still worse, someone has tried to keep the code cool and easy.

When we think that the decisions we make at the time of development are not up to the mark, we have changed this process.Difficulties raised in process of creating an app.
<br>• Various screen sizes:There are hundreds of sizes and resolutions of Android devices. It is very difficult to design optimal UI for these devices.
<br>• Sync data between mobile apps and backends if your app is for both online and offline use.
<br>• When performance driven apps are developed, it is important to ensure that there is no drainage of battery. 
<br>• Memory consumption
<br>• Data security
<br>• It is the dream of every developer to make their apps as explanatory as possible. But what is simple to the developer may not be so for the user.
