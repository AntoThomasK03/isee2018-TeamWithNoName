welcome to our third blog post in this blog post we would like to share our development phase of system design

The system design of is the core for the development of the app. we are going to demonstrate the interation of the app and the user with the help of State chart and sequence diagram and then we would like to explain in detail with the class diagram about al1 the classes and other attributes involved in the app and the association of classes to each other

Design Pattern

We are planning to use the facade design process also know as Structural Design Pattern.
We choose this pattern because it hides the complexity of the code by providing an easy interface to the user that can access the whole system. A single class provides all the methods required by the user from the system. We choose this pattern after carefully studying it from the examples from the blog androidexample1 it was our refernce for the design pattern as we are new to the design patterns.
