<br>Naming Conventions
 1. Classes:
Class names always begin with a capital letter (eg. java.util.Scanner). And if there are mutiple words in the class name then each word must also begin with a capital letter (eg. java.util.GregorianCalendar). Also package names always start with lowercase characters (util, lang, io, etc). And if there are multiple words in the package name, then you need to use uppercase for all words except for the starting word. This naming method is popularly called as UpperCamelCase which is a type of CamelCase! Interfaces also use same convention.
Eg: class MyClass {
    }
 2. Objects/Variables:
Java Naming convention specifies that instances and other variables must start with lowercase and if there are multiple words in the name, then you need to use Uppercase for starting letters for the words except for the starting word. This is called as lowerCamelCase.
Eg:String myName;
   MyClass myObject;
   Scanner scannerObject = new Scanner(System.in);
 3. Methods:
Methods in Java also follow the same lowerCamelCase convention like Objects and variables.
Eg:void myMethod() {
   }
