<h2>Why this course/Project for us?</h2>
 This project would be great baby steps for the students like us from a mechanical engineering background who have zero experience in the field of IT and can learn how the team works in the IT project so that it would come in handy further down the road. And moreover, activity monitor is a thing which we can closely relate to as keeping track of your time might do some good after all.

<h2> Goal </h2>
Our project goal is to develop an android app which can be easily accessed by an individual and monitor his schedule in an efficient way(ACTIVITY MONITOR).
Our goal as a team is to work together and to Learn and adapt the changing circumstances and customer requirements as the project continues further.
  
<h2>Brief introduction about the app</h2>
The app would track all the day to day activities of the user and help the user to be better organized.
Further features will be updated after the initial meeting with the customer as per the customer requirements.

<h2>Complementary Skills</h2>
As all team members are new to app development, but everyone has first hand experience in working together as a team. We are very enthusiastic to learn which will be a great asset to our team.
Every team member has their own set of skill on which we have divided our workload so that very work would bring their best for this project.

<h2>Communication</h2>
One of the key factor to work as a team is communication between the team members and the customer. To improve our efficiency we are following certain steps.
* We have a whatsapp group where quick short messages and suggestions are shared between team members.
* We scheduled our meetings based on availability of all our team members as of now twice a week.
* Every week the customer gets updated on the progress and any changes are made as per the customer requirements.
* As we are staying closer, so we can easily gather and discuss when it is necessary. 
* We are using Github so that every one can work on their own time and assemble it as a team. 
* We are also using google drive, Email for information transfer.
