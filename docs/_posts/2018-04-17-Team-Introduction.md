<h2>Communication</h2>
One of the key factor to work as a team is communication between the team members and the customer. To improve our efficiency we are following certain steps.
* We have a whatsapp group where quick short mesages and suggestions are shared between team menbers.
* We scheduled our meetings based on availability of all our team members as of now twice a week.
* Every week the customer gets upadted on the progress and any changes are made as per the customer requirements.
* As we are staying closer, so we can easily gather and discuss when it is necessary. 
* We are using Github so that every one can work on their own time and assemble it as a team. 
* We are also using google drive, Email for information transfer.
